// What is JavaScript? What is the role of JavaScript?

// JavaScript (often shortened as JS) is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used to make web pages interactive and dynamic.

// HTML defines the structure of a webpage.

// CSS controls the presentation and styling.

// JavaScript adds behavior and interactivity.

// Initially designed to run in web browsers, JavaScript is now also used outside the browser (thanks to Node.js) for backend development, servers, APIs, and even mobile or desktop applications. It is considered one of the core technologies of the web, alongside HTML and CSS.

// Key uses include:

// Form validation

// Animations and transitions

// Sliders and pop-ups

// Dropdown menus

// Interactive maps

// Games and web applications

// Role of JavaScript

// 1. Client-Side Interactivity
// Enables real-time user interaction without refreshing the page.
// Example: live search, chat applications, dynamic forms.

// 2. DOM Manipulation (Document Object Model)
// Can add, remove, or modify HTML elements and CSS styles dynamically.
// Example: changing the background color with a button click.

// 3. Event Handling
// Detects and responds to user actions such as clicks, hovers, typing, or scrolling.
// Example: displaying a dropdown menu when hovering over navigation.

// 4. Server Communication (AJAX & Fetch API)
// Sends and receives data from servers asynchronously, without reloading the page.
// Example: real-time weather updates, Google Maps zoom.

// 5. Backend Development (via Node.js)
// Powers server-side logic, APIs, database handling, and authentication.

// 6. Cross-Platform Applications
// Used for developing mobile apps (React Native, Ionic), desktop apps (Electron), and even IoT devices.;
